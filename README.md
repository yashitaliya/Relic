## 📱 Platform Behavior Notes

Relic supports both Android and iOS, with platform-correct media behavior:

- **Android:** SAF / file-based operations where applicable
- **iOS:** Photos-framework-based album operations (copy/move semantics differ from filesystem)
- Some actions (like true rename in iOS Photos library) are constrained by platform APIs

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **Media Access:** `photo_manager`
- **Storage/Prefs:** `shared_preferences`, `sqflite`, secure storage
- **Image/Video:** `photo_view`, `media_kit`, `pro_image_editor`
- **Other:** sharing, geocoding, permissions, encryption utilities
